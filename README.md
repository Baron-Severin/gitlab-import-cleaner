# gitlab-import-cleaner
Brittle (but useful) script which hides Gitlab diffs that include only changed import statements

To install:

-  Clone repo
-  In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions/
-  Near the top right corner of the screen, check "Developer mode"
-  Near the top left corner, click "Load unpacked extension..."
-  Select the project folder

To use:

-  When on a Gitlab diff
-  Click on the icon
-  (Note that collapsed diffs will not be modified.  Expand all to check all diffs)
